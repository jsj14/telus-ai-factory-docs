# Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines offer flexible, isolated environments with dedicated CPU, memory, and storage, ideal for a wide range of applications with scalable resource demands.

## Overview

Virtual Machines (VMs) provide the perfect balance between performance, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. They give you:

- Dedicated resources in an isolated environment
- Flexibility to scale resources up or down
- Quick provisioning and deployment
- Cost-effective computing for most workloads

## Key Features

### Flexible Resources
- Choose CPU, memory, and storage configurations
- Adjust resources as your needs change
- Support for various VM sizes

### Isolated Environments
- Each VM runs independently
- Secure separation from other workloads
- Dedicated resource allocation

### Quick Provisioning
- Deploy VMs in minutes
- Pre-configured OS images available
- Easy snapshot and backup capabilities

### Scalable
- Start small and grow as needed
- Add or remove VMs based on demand
- Vertical and horizontal scaling options

## Use Cases

### Development and Testing
Perfect for dev/test environments:
- Isolated development workspaces
- Testing different configurations
- CI/CD pipelines
- Staging environments

### Model Development
Ideal for ML model development:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and tuning
- Experimentation with different frameworks
- Prototype development

### Production Workloads
Run stable production applications:
- Web applications
- API servers
- Database servers
- Microservices

### Multi-Environment Deployments
Manage multiple environments:
- Development, staging, and production
- Different versions of applications
- Geographic distribution

## Creating a Virtual Machine

1. **Navigate** to the Virtual Machines section
2. **Click** "New Virtual Machine" button
3. **Select** VM configuration:
   - Operating system
   - CPU cores
   - Memory (RAM)
   - Storage size
   - Network settings
4. **Configure** additional options:
   - SSH keys
   - Startup scripts
   - Tags and labels
5. **Review** and deploy

## VM Configuration Options

### Compute Options
- **CPU**: 1-32+ cores
- **Memory**: 2GB-256GB+
- **GPU**: Optional GPU acceleration

### Storage Options
- **Boot Disk**: SSD or HDD
- **Additional Disks**: Attach as needed
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time backups

### Networking
- **Public IP**: Optional external access
- **Private Network**: VPC integration
- **Firewall Rules**: Security configuration

## Management Operations

### Instance Control
- Start, stop, and restart VMs
- Resize CPU and memory (with restart)
- Create snapshots for backup
- Clone VMs for replication

### Monitoring
- CPU and memory utilization
- Disk I/O metrics
- Network traffic
- Custom monitoring metrics

### Access and Security
- SSH key management
- Password authentication (if enabled)
- Security groups and firewall rules
- VPN and private network access

## Best Practices

### Right-Sizing
- Start with smaller instances
- Monitor actual resource usage
- Scale up only when needed
- Use monitoring data to optimize

### Security
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords
- Configure minimal firewall rules
- Keep OS and software updated
- Enable disk encryption

### Backup and Recovery
- Regular snapshots of critical VMs
- Test recovery procedures
- Document configurations
- Use automation for backups

### Cost Management
- Stop VMs when not in use
- Use appropriate instance sizes
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Set up alerts for unexpected costs
