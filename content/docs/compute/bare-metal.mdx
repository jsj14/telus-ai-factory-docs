# Bare Metal Servers

Bare Metal provides dedicated servers with full hardware access, strong isolation, and control for demanding workloads needing consistent performance or specific hardware.

## Overview

Bare Metal servers give you direct access to physical hardware without the overhead of virtualization. This makes them ideal for:

- High-performance machine learning training
- GPU-intensive workloads
- Applications requiring consistent, predictable performance
- Workloads that need specific hardware configurations

## Key Features

### Full Hardware Access
- Direct access to CPU, memory, and storage
- No virtualization overhead
- Maximum performance for compute-intensive tasks

### Strong Isolation
- Dedicated physical server
- No resource sharing with other tenants
- Enhanced security and privacy

### Consistent Performance
- Predictable, stable performance
- No "noisy neighbor" effects
- Ideal for benchmarking and time-sensitive workloads

### Hardware Flexibility
- Choose specific CPU, GPU, and memory configurations
- Customize storage options
- Select network connectivity

## Use Cases

### Machine Learning Training
Train large models with maximum performance:
- Deep learning model training
- Large-scale data processing
- GPU-accelerated computations

### High-Performance Computing
Run demanding computational workloads:
- Scientific simulations
- Data analytics pipelines
- Batch processing jobs

### Custom Hardware Requirements
When you need specific hardware:
- Specialized GPU models
- Large memory configurations
- High-speed storage arrays

## Creating a Bare Metal Server

1. **Navigate** to the Bare Metal section in the Developer Hub
2. **Click** "New Bare Metal" button
3. **Select** your hardware configuration:
   - CPU type and core count
   - Memory amount
   - GPU type and count (if needed)
   - Storage configuration
4. **Configure** network settings
5. **Review** and deploy your server

## Management

Once deployed, you can:

- Access your server via SSH
- Install and configure software
- Monitor resource usage
- Scale storage as needed
- View performance metrics

## Best Practices

### Resource Planning
- Estimate your compute requirements accurately
- Consider future scaling needs
- Plan for redundancy if needed

### Security
- Use SSH keys for authentication
- Configure firewalls appropriately
- Keep software up to date
- Implement monitoring and logging

### Cost Optimization
- Right-size your server configuration
- Use scheduling for non-continuous workloads
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
