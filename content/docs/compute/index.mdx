## Choosing the Right Compute Resource

### Use Bare Metal When:
- You need maximum performance and consistent low latency
- Your workload requires direct hardware access
- You're running resource-intensive training jobs
- You need specific hardware configurations

### Use Virtual Machines When:
- You need flexible, isolated environments
- You want dedicated CPU, memory, and storage
- You're running a wide range of applications
- You need scalable resource demands

### Use Kubernetes When:
- You're deploying containerized applications
- You need efficient resource management
- You want automated scaling and orchestration
- You're running microservices architectures

## Common Features

All compute resources include:

- **High-Performance Hardware** - Optimized for ML workloads
- **Flexible Configuration** - Choose resources that fit your needs
- **Secure Isolation** - Protected environments for your workloads
- **Easy Management** - Simple creation and administration through the Developer Hub
