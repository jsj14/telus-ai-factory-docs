# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with the TELUS AI Factory Developer Hub and create your first resources.

## Accessing the Developer Hub

The Developer Hub is accessible through your TELUS platform account. Once logged in, you'll see the main interface with access to all compute and service resources.

## Understanding the Interface

The Developer Hub interface is organized into several key sections:

### Navigation Sidebar

The left sidebar provides quick access to:

- **Home** - Dashboard overview
- **Workspaces** - Manage your project workspaces
- **Compute** - Access compute resources (Bare Metal, VMs, Kubernetes)
- **Services** - Access managed services (Notebooks, Inference endpoints)

### Main Content Area

The main area displays:

- Service cards with descriptions
- Action buttons to create new resources
- "View All" links to see existing resources

### Tabs

Use tabs to filter between:

- **All** - View all available resources
- **Compute** - Filter to compute resources only
- **Services** - Filter to services only

## Creating Your First Resource

Each resource type has a dedicated creation flow:

1. **Navigate** to the desired resource section
2. **Click** the "New [Resource Type]" button
3. **Configure** your resource using the setup wizard
4. **Deploy** and start using your resource

## Managing Workspaces

Workspaces help organize your projects and resources:

- Create separate workspaces for different projects
- Switch between workspaces using the workspace selector
- Each workspace maintains its own set of resources
